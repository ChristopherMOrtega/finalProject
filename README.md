Simple 2-D bullet-hell boss fight as a platypus with screen wiping deaths

WASD to move, space to shoot, dodge from fly and watch out for the goon

utilized a lot of stack overflow

All visual and audio assests in the game are made by me.

I started with making the player/platypus and getting his movements down and the ability to shoot.
From there I implemented adding the boss in and detecting collision from the player with the boss.
Next came the ability for the boss to fire out.
Followed by collisions with that and the player.
After that came displaying an indicator to the player of where a one-shot ability is going to appear from.
Afterwards added the actual model for the one-shot.
Collision detection.
And finally implemented a HUD of sorts.

What did I learn?

- Things are sometimes more simple than you think they are. And the simple things have a strong way of being more complicated.

Where did I get stuck?

- Collisions took a considerable amount of time, tried mulitple methods and landed on an amalgamation of 2.

What would I like to improve?

- The mechanics of the fight didn't come out quite the way I had envisioned, boss doesn't attack often enough.

How would you do things differently next time?

- I think I would start with an idea of how to implement something and follow it through until I was confident that solution didn't work. I think right now I probably have some redudancies in place.

How far did you stray from the original design document?

- I think I stayed pretty true to my idea, albeit perhaps more simple than I went into it with.

How did you stay on track?

- I had a clear vision of what it is that I wanted.
